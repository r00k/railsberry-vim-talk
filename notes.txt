what holds intermediate vimmers back?
  high-level
    they're not actively trying to improve
      pay more attention!
        frequently-repeated commands are high-value
          be obnoxiously intolerant of extra typing
            C-s instead of :w
            <Leader>w instead of C-w w
          bind a ton of leaders
        also watch for occasional operations that are particularly slow
          record a macro for turning var into a let
          record a macro for extracting a method (we're gonna do this later)
        accept your typos and bind them
      always be learning
        understand accretion - have a cheat sheet
    their vimrcs suck
      an empty vimrc is great in the beginning
      I don't like janus
      your vimrc should be growing roughly linearly with your skill
      mike burns' vimrc
    they don't rtfm
      editing effectively is great

  low-level
    they use the arrow keys
    they never learned key concepts
      registers
        yanking into a register
        :registers
        "0 
      macros
      vimscript
